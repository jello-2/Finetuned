Benchmarked, Finetuned, and Re-Benchmarked experiment on `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`, `fp16`. Benchmarking completed on AMC 12 A 2024. Attempted to fine-tune with MATH dataset.


# Benchmark 1:

48 / 150 (partials not counted)

Params: `do_sample = False`, `max_new_tokens=1024`

Notes: Slight hallucination even once end token is seen. Cannot seem to match numbers to letters and gives numeric form.
